## 🧑💻 Data Engineering Code Sample

```python
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

# Connect to MySQL Server
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="127.0.0.1",
    port=3306,
    user="root",
    password="********"  # Use your password here
)

# Query to fetch customer data
query = "SELECT * FROM banking_analysis.customers"
df = pd.read_sql(query, cnx)

cnx.close()
```
